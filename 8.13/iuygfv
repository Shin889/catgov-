          <p><strong>Historical Background</strong> </p>
          <a<p style="text-align: justify;" actual founding of Virac as a distinct political unit is closely
              associated with the evangelization of its original inhabitants by the Spanish conquistadores in the
              middle of the 16th century. Records of the past are so fragile, inconsistent and incomplete that events
              presented are an admixture of facts and folklore. Virac became officially recognized as a unit of
              governance only in 1755 as it was only during that year when records were started to be faithfully
              kept.</p>

              <p><strong>Pre-Hispanic Era</strong> </p>
              <p>The first settlers to have set foot in the island province of Catanduanes were the scions of Bornean
                  datus who came to the island of Panay and spread through the length and breadth of the Philippine
                  archipelago in the 13th century. The first signs of human activity which began to be manifested in
                  the middle of the 14th century were presumed to be that of the Malays who populated and developed
                  some parts of Southern Luzon during the period.

                  Other adventurers in search of better opportunities for trade and commerce eventually stayed and
                  established settlements along the coastal confines of this tiny island during the 11th century. </p>

              <p><strong>The Naming of Virac</strong></p>
              <p>From the exploits of Juan de Salcedo, Virac was first visited in 1573 by his own men in pursuit of
                  pirates operating in the Bicol Peninsula. In Virac, the Spanish found a tribe under the leadership
                  of one Datu Lumibao, scion of Datu Dumaguil who came to the Philippines with the 13 Malay datus and
                  his wife Melbigan and son Macaco who settled near Vidak spring and founded the first civilized
                  settlement with a score of servant followers and their wives. Some say Virac is a derivation of the
                  word “Vidac” while others claim it is a contraction of the Spanish version of the word burac,
                  meaning flower.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Christianization</strong></p>
              <p> A few weeks after the suppression of the pirates, the Spaniards returned with Dominican
                  missionaries. Offering friendship and gifts, they were able to convert the tribe into the fold of
                  Christendom. The first tribe conversion thus became Spain’s initial foothold to the island’s
                  eventual Christianization.</p>

              <p><strong>Spanish Era</strong></p>
              <p>In the 16th to 17th century, after establish and Christianizing settlements, a form of governance
                  called “Encommiendas” was subsequently introduced as a guide to the socio-political development of
                  each community.

                  The turbulent years of the late 18th century brought about by the sporadic incursions of the
                  non-Christians on the prosperous settlements along the coast spawned myths about local heroes and
                  essentially hastened the unification of Virac into a strong bastion against the forces opposed to
                  Christianity. Stone chapels which proliferated along the coastal barangays had for years alternately
                  served as places of refuge and worship of its people.</p>

              <p><strong>Local Insurrection</strong></p>
              <p>The growing concern for better recognition and more participation of the natives in government
                  affairs gave rise to rebellion. The nationwide uprising was upheld but lacked the necessary support
                  due to the fairer treatment obtained locally.</p>

              <p><strong> American Regime</strong></p>
              <p>Local resistance to the abrupt change of masters was more vigorous and gained wider acceptance. Not
                  as eager to relinquish their hard-fought freedom, the “Katipuneros” refused to recognize the
                  sovereignty of the new masters and fled to the mountains. The Americans’ might however, proved too
                  formidable and quickly, all oppositions were subdued.

                  The American occupation ended in 1934 with the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth.</p>

              <p><strong>Japanese Occupation</strong></p>
              <p>With hardly a brief respite from foreign occupation, World War II brought new and untold woes,
                  hardship and anxieties. Catanduanes was not spared from the Japanese onslaught. The Kamikura
                  Regime established a puppet government centered on the capital town of Virac. All economic
                  activities virtually stood at standstill. Even schools were temporarily closed.

                  The liberation of Catanduanes took place at what is now the present municipal building and the Virac
                  Parish Cathedral. On February 8, 1945, the local guerrillas gained full control of the Japanese
                  barracks.

                  On April 22, 1945, Virac resumed its normal operations under the regime of the Philippine Civil
                  Affairs Unit.</p>

              <p><strong>Post American Liberation</strong></p>
              <p>The challenge of rebuilding the municipality from the ravages of the war was put on the shoulders of
                  Florencio Tacorda, Geronimo Tabuzo and Primo Panti who, among themselves, held the stewardship of
                  Virac from 1945 to 1957.</p>

              <p><strong>Pre and Martial Law Era</strong></p>
              <p>From 1958-1970, Salvador Surtida took over followed by Jorge Arcilla from 1970-1986, two of the
                  longest reigning local executives in the history of Virac. This period witnessed the ascendancy to
                  national prominence of the Alberto brothers, Juan, Jose and Vicente, who doubtlessly brought
                  progress and influenced the massive physical transformation of the municipality when Salvador
                  Surtida and Jorge Arcilla were mayors. Foremost among the many infrastructure projects were the
                  Catanduanes State Colleges and the Eastern Bicol Medical Center which placed Virac in the map as a
                  major educational and health center in the Bicol Region.

                  The growth of Virac in terms of governance peaked in 1972. From the original 34 barangays in 1960,
                  Virac was able to establish 29 new communities to upgrade to the present composition of 63
                  barangays. The declaration of martial law on September 21, 1972, despite the alleged rampant
                  atrocities, had, by and large, no ill effects on the lives of the constituency, who by nature are
                  peace-loving and law-abiding citizens.</p>

              <p><strong>EDSA Revolution</strong></p>
              <p>The EDSA Revolution in1986 which toppled down the more than two decades of Marcos regime had a domino
                  effect on the political structure of Virac. The replacement of the elected officials by appointed
                  officials was in accordance with the Freedom Constitution which predominated during the
                  revolutionary government from 1986 to1992. Rodulfo Sarmiento, a doctor by profession held the reins
                  of the municipal government.</p>

              <p><strong>Post EDSA</strong></p>
              <p>The early nineties and onward saw the alternate changing of guard at the helm of local governance
                  between Rodulfo Sarmiento and Jose “Cito” Alberto II, the son of Congressman Jose Alberto. The
                  operation of the ferry boat which facilitates the transfer of goods and services from the Bicol
                  mainland to Virac ushered in the vibrance in trade and commerce as manifested by the modern unseen
                  before but now dotting the commercial centers and the bee-line of private and public conveyances
                  plying the streets. Growing political maturity has been apparent in barangay affairs operation and
                  so with the swell in the number of non-government organizations which is an indication of growing
                  people empowerment.

                  With the advent of the third millennium came the resurgence of the physical face lift of Virac as
                  more public structures have been erected and upgraded during the second “tour of duty” of incumbent
                  Mayor Jose “Cito” Alberto.

                  The socio-political annals of Virac shall continue to increase its pages and one thing is certain:
                  the municipality stands to gain – physically, economically and socially in its self-waged battle for
                  progress.</p>
