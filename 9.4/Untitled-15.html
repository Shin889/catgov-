        <p>The village town then was luxuriant and verdant with “badas” plants.

        <p><strong>History</strong> </p>
        <p>Once called “Badas” during the early Spanish colonization it has now metamorphosed into what are now Baras. The village town then was luxuriant and verdant with “badas” plants. As to what kind of vegetation “badas” was, is a subject of conjuncture, for some believed that it was a kind of bamboo now called “bagacay”. Others believed it to be kind of sturdy tree, but majority believed that it is a wild rattan plant abounding the surrounding mountains.

But one common belief is the fact that the Moro raiders agreed that “badas” was in demand as materials for building the native huts, for making spears, a weapon used by the native to repel the raiders and pirates. Because of its abundance in the area, villagers called the place “Cabadasan”, meaning a place where “Badas” thrive. The colonizers however, Hispanized it and so the town was called “BARAS” up to this time.

Some elders recall that Baras, centuries back was once s progressive fishing village located over a small mountain projecting towards the sea on the western side of Baras Bay. The poblacion was its cemetery and the cemetery now was its former poblacion site. The old site was chosen because it was an elevated area overlooking the sea. The villagers could easily see approaching pirates that occasionally plundered the sea, giving them ample time to evacuate their families and prepare for the encounter. Excavation in the Church Plaza reveals human remains of evaders. The pirates gone, the villagers later settled in what are now Baras.
A splintered group of insurrectos who was facing the advantage of the insurrection taking place in the Southern Tagalog region, braved the rough seas to set a place in the long quest for Philippine Independence in the Island, forced by the gusty Southeast Monsoon wind they finally set anchor in the once rich fishing village called “Cabadasan” posing as fisherman.

By befriending the villagers and at the same time working on the growing discontent among the people against the tyrannical rule of Capitan CARLOS MACAPUGAY who was then the town executive, the rebel grouped the men folk of the village to form a fierce fighting bond. Out of this uprising led by Catalino Catakutan, the umbilical cord through which Cabadasan ruled was detached and the town of Baras was born. Capitan Catakutan, with the burning desire for independence, did not live long to set office in the entire province.

The Spaniards caught up with him while attending a wedding feast. Tortured and chained by the neck, he was paraded around the poblacion of Bato to serve as warning to the people. He was hanged near the church of Bato. Baras’ original barrios were Tilod, Macutal, Paniquihan and Gigmoto.
The early year of Baras as a town was a period of difficult adjustment. In 1905, construction of a semi-permanent Municipal Building called “TRIBUNAL” was started. In 1907 due to financial difficulties the town was reverted to a barrio status. Baras existed as a barrio up to the last days of 1909. Before the end of the year 1909, Civic religious and business leaders of the community demanded from the ruling governing power that Baras be recreated into a municipality. In 1910, Baras, became a town for the second time.

From then Baras move on experiencing the test of time as a municipality. In 1927 Camu Street was constructed connecting it to San Lorenzo Street. In 1929 the present light house in barrio Putsan was constructed. In May 1933, the Bato-Baras road was opened to traffic. In 1935 the gold boom reached Baras, an American firm dug sitio Banog in Agban and started what it seemed a flourishing firm, the Agban gold mines.

Baras is located on the southeast of the province. On the north it is bounded by the town of Gigmoto, on the west by San Miguel and on the east it is bounded by the Pacific Ocean. Baras is bestowed with about seven rivers/creeks of which drain their way to the sea facing the Pacific Ocean. Spring is abundantly found all over the municipality. With its unexploited environment, unspoiled beaches and simple and affordable resort facilities, Baras is gearing towards the major tourist destination of the province.

Abaca production is the major source of income followed by copra and field crops (cassava, camote or sweet potato and other vegetables). Rice production in the municipality is not enough for local consumption due to limited arable land considering the terrain of the place. However some barangays (villages or barrios) are continuously opening new rice fields in the form of rice terraces that could be irrigated by springs in the hillside. Fishing is prosperous only in some barangays and the catch is only enough for the community consumption. Fishing is limited due to the strong pacific waves that confronts majority of the shorelines.

The town is peaceful, the crime rate is very low, hospitality is prevalent and expenses are low. Being a predominantly Roman Catholic municipality, the culture of the people is traditional with close knitted social and family structures.
